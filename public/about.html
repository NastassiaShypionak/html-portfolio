<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, there! My name is Nastassia Shypionak, or everyone calls me Nastia for short.
Currently I'm a student, I study Game Design and Development. I really enjoy programming and take some courses online besides required for my major.
</p>

<p>I have decided to try myself in Web Development and took a course from Angela Yu. Hopefully I will succeed and be able to become a good Developer.</p>

<p>I speak several languages and enjoy to learn something new. I like spending time with my favorite dog, eat good food and do different activities:) </p>
